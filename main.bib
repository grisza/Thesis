New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modifica- tion to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite- memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co- efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are ob- tained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.},

	abstract = {In 1960, R.E. Kalman published his famous paper describing a recursive solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem. Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers {\&} results.},

	abstract = {This paper points out the flaws in using the extended Kalman filter (EKE) and introduces an improvement, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), proposed by Julier and Uhlman (1997). A central and vital operation performed in the Kalman filter is the propagation of a Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics. In the EKF the state distribution is approximated by a GRV, which is then propagated analytically through the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the true posterior mean and covariance of the transformed GRV, which may lead to sub-optimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter. The UKF addresses this problem by using a deterministic sampling approach. The state distribution is again approximated by a GRV, but is now represented using a minimal set of carefully chosen sample points. These sample points completely capture the true mean and covariance of the GRV, and when propagated through the true nonlinear system, captures the posterior mean and covariance accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series expansion) for any nonlinearity. The EKF in contrast, only achieves first-order accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the UKF is the same order as that of the EKF. Julier and Uhlman demonstrated the substantial performance gains of the UKF in the context of state-estimation for nonlinear control. Machine learning problems were not considered. We extend the use of the UKF to a broader class of nonlinear estimation problems, including nonlinear system identification, training of neural networks, and dual estimation problems. In this paper, the algorithms are further developed and illustrated with a number of additional examples},

The outputs of such systems are characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases. We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO (3) driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements. Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error. The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal group a related observer, termed the passive complementary filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online. The passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware; and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the question of using a nonlinear complementary filter for attitude estimation of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) given only measurements from a low-cost inertial measurement unit. A nonlinear complementary filter is proposed that combines accelerometer output for low frequency attitude estimation with integrated gyrometer output for high frequency estimation. The raw accelerometer output includes a component corresponding to airframe acceleration, occurring primarily when the aircraft turns, as well as the gravitational acceleration that is required for the filter. The airframe acceleration is estimated using a simple centripetal force model (based on additional airspeed measurements), augmented by a first order dynamic model for angle-of-attack, and used to obtain estimates of the gravitational direction independent of the airplane manoeuvres. Experimental results are provided on a real-world data set and the performance of the filter is evaluated against the output from a full GPS/INS that was available for the data set.},

@article{Madgwick2010,
	abstract = {Abstract This report presents a novel orientation filter applicable to IMUs consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and MARG sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion and gyroscope bias drift compensation. The filter uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient-descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. The benefits of the filter include: (1) computationally inexpensive; requiring 109 (IMU) or 277 (MARG) scalar arithmetic operations each filter update, (2) effective at low sampling rates; e.g. 10 Hz, and (3) contains 1 (IMU) or 2 (MARG) adjustable parameters defined by observable system characteristics. Performance was evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. A simple calibration method is presented for the use of the optical measurement equipment in this application. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the filter achieves levels of accuracy exceeding that of the Kalman-based algorithm; < 0.6◦ static RMS error, < 0.8◦ dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at low sampling rates open new opportunities for the use of IMU and MARG sensor arrays in real-time applications of limited power or processing resources or applications that demand extremely high sampling rates.},

@article{Tian2015a,
	abstract = {Upper limb motion tracking attracts attentions from both academia and industry due to its value in a wide range of applications. Although existing optical-based tracking techniques can provide accurate tracking results, the product cost and complexity keep them away from most daily life applications. Recently, low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU) and Kinect techniques provide a feasible/economical solution for such trajectory tracking problems while either of them still has its own limitations. In this paper, we investigated how to fuse data from internal sensors of IMU, and fuse IMU data with Kinect in order to provide robust hand position information compensated for the limitations of those sensors. The calculation of position is sequentially achieved by three fusion strategies: double integration of IMU internal sensors, IMU internal sensor fusion with geometrical constraints and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) based fusion of IMU and Kinect. Experimental results show that the first two approaches suffer from drifting effects, while the proposed IMU and Kinect fusion method can provide drift-free and smooth results. Comparing with using Kinect alone, this approach is able to achieve better results in terms of both accuracy as well as robustness.},

Restricting attention to right-handed coordinate systems and positive rotations, twelve distinct but equivalent sets of Euler angles are partitioned into two subsets. The method of determining a set of orthogonal infinitesimal rotations equivalent to nonorthogonal infinitesimal increments on a set of Euler angles is illustrated. It is shown that the same solution yields expressions for the angular velocities of the final coordinate system relative to the reference coordinate system in terms of derivatives of the Euler angles. The ease with which the infinitesimal increments of one Euler set in terms of the increments of another equivalent Euler set can be determined by the symbolic technique is illustrated. This technique offers a systematic approach to error analysis of sequences of rotations.},

Then, we compare them regarding to several criteria: required equipment, light pattern coding, color analysis, texture analysis, motion analysis, security, use in non-controlled environment.

We investigate the possibilities of using multiple Kinects in the same en- vironment for capturing opaque and translucent objects in motion.

A practical and straightforward method of determining the power spectral density of the frequency fluctuations from the variance of the frequency fluctuations, the sampling time, the number of samples taken, and the dependence on system bandwidth is also developed. Additional insight is also given into some of the problems that arise from the presence of Wicker noise” (spectrum proportional to I w 1 -l) modulation of the frequency of an oscillator. The theory is applied in classifying the types of noise on the signals of frequency standards made available at NBS, Boulder Laboratories, such as: masers (both H and NsH{\&} the cesium beam frequency standard employed as the U. S. Frequency Standard, and rubidium gas cells. “Flicker noise” frequency modulation was not observed on the signals of masers for sampling times ranging from 0.1 second to 4 hours. In a comparison between the NBS hydrogen maser and the NBS III cesium beam, uncorrelated random noise was observed on the frequency fluctuations for sampling times extending to 4 hours; the fractional standard deviations of the frequency fluctuations were as low as 5 parts in IOL4},

@article{El-Sheimy2008,
	abstract = {It is well known that inertial navigation systems can provide high-accuracy position, velocity, and attitude information over short time periods. However, their accuracy rapidly degrades with time. The requirements for an accurate estimation of navigation information necessitate the modeling of the sensors' error components. Several variance techniques have been devised for stochastic modeling of the error of inertial sensors. They are basically very similar and primarily differ in that various signal processings, by way of weighting functions, window functions, etc., are incorporated into the analysis algorithms in order to achieve a particular desired result for improving the model characterizations. The simplest is the Allan variance. The Allan variance is a method of representing the root means square (RMS) random-drift error as a function of averaging time. It is simple to compute and relatively simple to interpret and understand. The Allan variance method can be used to determine the characteristics of the underlying random processes that give rise to the data noise. This technique can be used to characterize various types of error terms in the inertial-sensor data by performing certain operations on the entire length of data. In this paper, the Allan variance technique will be used in analyzing and modeling the error of the inertial sensors used in different grades of the inertial measurement units. By performing a simple operation on the entire length of data, a characteristic curve is obtained whose inspection provides a systematic characterization of various random errors contained in the inertial-sensor output data. Being a directly measurable quantity, the Allan variance can provide information on the types and magnitude of the various error terms. This paper covers both the theoretical basis for the Allan variance for modeling the inertial sensors' error terms and its implementation in modeling different grades of inertial sensors.},

Often, two or more different sensors are used to obtain reliable data useful for control systems. The paper presents the data fusion system for mobile robot navigation. Odometry and sonar signals are fused using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Adaptive Fuzzy Logic System (AFLS). The signals used during navigation cannot be always considered as white noise signals. On the other hand, colored signals will cause the EKF to diverge. The AFLS was used to adapt the gain and therefore prevent Kalman filter divergence. The fused signal is more accurate than any of the original signals considered separately. The enhanced more accurate signal is used to guide and navigate the robot.},

	abstract = {Objective: To test the reliability and validity of shoulder joint angle measurements from the Microsoft Kinect™ for virtual rehabilitation. Design: Test-retest reliability and concurrent validity, feasibility study. Setting: Motion analysis laboratory. Participants: A convenience sample of 10 healthy adults. Methods: Shoulder joint angle was assessed in four static poses, two trials for each pose, using: (1) the Kinect; (2) a three-dimensional motion analysis system; and (3) a clinical goniometer. All poses were captured with the Kinect from the frontal view. The two poses of shoulder flexion were also captured with the Kinect from the sagittal view. Main outcome measures: Absolute and relative test-retest reliability of the Kinect for the measurement of shoulder angle was determined in each pose with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), standard error of the measure and minimal detectable change. The 95{\%} limits of agreement (LOA) between the Kinect and the standard methods for measuring shoulder angle were computed to determine concurrent validity. Results: While the Kinect provided to be highly reliable (ICC 0.76-0.98) for measuring shoulder angle from the frontal view, the 95{\%} LOA between the Kinect and the two measurement standards were greater than ±5° in all poses for both views. Conclusions: Before the Kinect is used to measure movements for virtual rehabilitation applications, it is imperative to understand its limitations in precision and accuracy for the measurement of specific joint motions.},

Such motion patterns in animals and men are termed here as biological motion. They are characterized by a far higher degree of complexity than the patterns of simple mechanical motions usually studied in our laboratories. In everyday perceptions, the visual information from biological motion and from the corresponding figurative contour patterns (the shape of the body) are intermingled. A method for studying information from the motion pattern per se without interference with the form aspect was devised. In short, the motion of the living body was represented by a few bright spots describing the motions of the main joints. It is found that 10--12 such elements in adequate motion combinations in proximal stimulus evoke a compelling impression of human walking, running, dancing, etc. The kinetic-geometric model for visual vector analysis originally developed in the study of perception of motion combinations of the mechanical type was applied to these biological motion patterns. The validity of this model in the present context was experimentally tested and the results turned out to be highly positive.",

The motion measurement system utilizes a video-based data collection strategy similar to commercially available systems for motion data collection. Anatomically aligned, passive, retroreflective markers placed on the subject are illuminated, detected, and stored in dedicated camera hardware while data are acquired from force platforms and EMG transducers. Three-dimensional marker position information is used to determine: (i) the orientation of segmentally-embedded coordinate systems, (ii) instantaneous joint center locations, and (iii) joint angles. Joint kinetics, i.e., moments and powers, may also be computed if valid force plate data are collected. ?? 1991.},

@article{Sundaresan2005,
abstract = {Motion capture has important applications in different areas such as biomechanics, computer animation, and human-computer interaction. Current motion capture methods use passive markers that are attached to different body parts of the subject and are therefore intrusive in nature. In applications such as pathological human movement analysis, these markers may introduce an unknown artifact in the motion, and are, in general, cumbersome. We present computer vision based methods for performing markerless human motion capture. We model the human body as a set of super-quadrics connected in an articulated structure and propose algorithms to estimate the parameters of the model from video sequences. We compute a volume data (voxel) representation from the images and combine bottom-up approach with top down approach guided by our knowledge of the model. We propose a tracking algorithm that uses this model to track human pose. The tracker uses an iterative framework akin to an Iterated Extended Kalman Filter to estimate articulated human motion using multiple cues that combine both spatial and temporal information in a novel manner. We provide preliminary results using data collected from 8-16 cameras. The emphasis of our work is on models and algorithms that are able to scale with respect to the requirement for accuracy. Our ultimate objective is to build an end-to-end system that can integrate the above mentioned components into a completely automated markerless motion capture system.},

	abstract = {Motion Analysis, Inertial Measurement Unit, IMU, Motion Tracking, Kinect, Data Fusion, Kalman Filter. This paper presents an approach for the tracking of limb movements using orientation information acquired from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and optical information from a Kinect sensor. A new algorithm that uses a Kalman filter to fuse the Kinect and IMU data is presented. By fusing optical and orientation information we are able to track the movement of limb joints precisely, and almost drift-free. First, the IMU data is processed using the gradient descent algorithm proposed in (Madgwick et al., 2011) which calculates the orientation information of the IMU using acceleration and velocity data. Measurements made with IMUs tend to drift over time, so in a second stage we compensate for the drift using absolute position information obtained from a Microsoft Kinect sensor. The fusion of sensor data also allows to compensate for faulty or missing measurements. We have carried out some initial experiments on arm tracking. The first results show that our technique for data fusion has the potential to be used to record common medical exercises for clinical movement analysis.},

abstract = {Thick soft tissue and structures involved in the knee's function surround the knee thus hiding the underlying kinematics. This makes diagnosis of pathologies and analysis of biomechanics difficult. This study accurately quantifies the relative movement between skin and the underlying bone, via X-ray flouroscopy and a mathematical model, in the interest of improving non-invasive knee movement analysis methods. It was found that skin-bone movement varies significantly over both medial and lateral femoral condyles (from 2 to 17 mm rms) and is, therefore, the greatest obstacle by far to obtaining accurate movement data non-intrusively. Data from the proposed method is fundamental to improving acquisition methods for knee biomechanics and prosthetic analysis and can help in understanding soft tissue movement for orthotic analysis.},

@article{Reinschmidt2016,
abstract = {It is not known how well skin markers represent the skeletal knee joint motion during running. Hence, the purpose of this investigation was to compare the skin marker derived tibiofemoral motion with the skeletal tibiofemoral motion during running. In addition to skin markers attached to the shank and thigh, triads of reflective markers were attached to bone pins inserted into the tibia and femur. Three-dimensional kinematics of the stance phase of five running trials were recorded for three subjects using high speed cine cameras (200 Hz). The knee motion was expressed in terms of Cardan angles calculated from both the external and skeletal markers. Good agreement was present between the skin and bone marker based knee flexion/extension. For abduction/adduction and internal/external knee rotation, the difference between skeletal and external motion was large compared to the amplitude of these motions. Average errors relative to the range of motion during running stance were 21{\%} for flexion/extension, 63{\%} for internal/external rotation, and 70{\%} for abduction/adduction. The errors were highly subject dependent preventing the realization of a successful correction algorithm. It was concluded that knee rotations other than flexion/extension may be affected with substantial errors when using skin markers.},

@article{Leardini2005,
abstract = {When using optoelectronic stereophotogrammetry, skin deformation and displacement causes marker movement with respect to the underlying bone. This movement represents an artifact, which affects the estimation of the skeletal system kinematics, and is regarded as the most critical source of error in human movement analysis. A comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art for assessment, minimization and compensation of the soft tissue artifact (STA) is provided. It has been shown that STA is greater than the instrumental error associated with stereophotogrammetry, has a frequency content similar to the actual bone movement, is task dependent and not reproducible among subjects and, of lower limb segments, is greatest at the thigh. It has been shown that in in vivo experiments only motion about the flexion/extension axis of the hip, knees and ankles can be determined reliably. Motion about other axes at those joints should be regarded with much more caution as this artifact produces spurious effects with magnitudes comparable to the amount of motion actually occurring in those joints. Techniques designed to minimize the contribution of and compensate for the effects of this artifact can be divided up into those which model the skin surface and those which include joint motion constraints. Despite the numerous solutions proposed, the objective of reliable estimation of 3D skeletal system kinematics using skin markers has not yet been satisfactorily achieved and greatly limits the contribution of human movement analysis to clinical practice and biomechanical research. For STA to be compensated for effectively, it is here suggested that either its subject-specific pattern is assessed by ad hoc exercises or it is characterized from a large series of measurements on different subject populations. Alternatively, inclusion of joint constraints into a more general STA minimization approach may provide an acceptable solution. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

These sensors have complementary properties. The Kinect can be applied for skeleton tracking, which gives the joints' positions. Meanwhile, the built-in inertial sensors in the mobile device sense the hand motion and the acceleration can be estimated through inertial sensor fusion.

Experimental results show that the hand accelerations estimated with the Kinect sensor and the inertial sensors are comparable. Secondly, design and apply a multi-rate Kalman filter for sensor fusion. The sensor fusion helps improve the accuracy of the system state estimation including the position, the velocity and the acceleration.

	This paper presents a tracking system for ego-motion estimation which fuses vision and inertial measurements using EKF and UKF (Extended and Unscented Kalman Filters), where a comparison of their performance has been done. It also considers the multi-rate nature of the sensors: inertial sensing is sampled at a fast sampling frequency while the sampling frequency of vision is lower. the proposed approach uses a constant linear acceleration model and constant angular velocity model based on quaternions, which yields a non-linear model for states and a linear model in measurement equations. Results show that a significant improvement is obtained on the estimation when fusing both measurements with respect to just vision or just inertial measurements. It is also shown that the proposed system can estimate fast-motions even when vision system fails. Moreover, a study of the influence of the noise covariance is also performed, which aims to select their appropriate values at the tuning process. The setup is an end-effector mounted camera, which allow us to pre-define basic rotational and translational motions for validating results.

In this paper, we derive an efficient filtering algorithm for tracking human pose using a stream of monocular depth images. The key idea is to combine an accurate generative model - which is achievable in this setting using programmable graphics hardware - with a discriminative model that provides data-driven evidence about body part locations. In each filter iteration, we apply a form of local model-based search that exploits the nature of the kinematic chain. As fast movements and occlusion can disrupt the local search, we utilize a set of discriminatively trained patch classifiers to detect body parts. We describe a novel algorithm for propagating this noisy evidence about body part locations up the kinematic chain using the unscented transform. The resulting distribution of body configurations allows us to reinitialize the model-based search. We provide extensive experimental results on 28 real-world sequences using automatic ground-truth annotations from a commercial motion capture system.},

Even though recent approaches have shown that 3D pose estimation from monocular 2.5D depth images has become feasible, there are still challenging problems due to strong noise in the depth data and self-occlusions in the motions being captured. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust pose estimation framework for tracking full-body motions from a single depth image stream. Following a data-driven hybrid strategy that combines local optimization with global retrieval techniques, we contribute several technical improvements that lead to speed-ups of an order of magnitude compared to previous approaches. In particular, we introduce a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently extract pose features from the depth data and describe a novel late-fusion scheme based on an efficiently computable sparse Hausdorff distance to combine local and global pose estimates. Our experiments show that the combination of these techniques facilitates real-time tracking with stable results even for fast and complex motions, making it applicable to a wide range of inter-active scenarios.},

This paper presents an approach for the tracking of limb movements using orientation information acquired from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and optical information from a Kinect sensor. A new algorithm that uses a Kalman filter to fuse the Kinect and IMU data is presented. By fusing optical and orientation information we are able to track the movement of limb joints precisely, and almost drift-free. First, the IMU data is processed using the gradient descent algorithm proposed in (Madgwick et al., 2011) which calculates the orientation information of the IMU using acceleration and velocity data. Measurements made with IMUs tend to drift over time, so in a second stage we compensate for the drift using absolute position information obtained from a Microsoft Kinect sensor. The fusion of sensor data also allows to compensate for faulty or missing measurements. We have carried out some initial experiments on arm tracking. The first results show that our technique for data fusion has the potential to be used to record common medical exercises for clinical movement analysis.},

@article{Agarwal2006,
	abstract = {We describe a learning-based method for recovering 3D human body pose from single images and monocular image sequences. Our approach requires neither an explicit body model nor prior labeling of body parts in the image. Instead, it recovers pose by direct nonlinear regression against shape descriptor vectors extracted automatically from image silhouettes. For robustness against local silhouette segmentation errors, silhouette shape is encoded by histogram-of-shape-contexts descriptors. We evaluate several different regression methods: ridge regression, Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression over both linear and kernel bases. The RVMs provide much sparser regressors without compromising performance, and kernel bases give a small but worthwhile improvement in performance. The loss of depth and limb labeling information often makes the recovery of 3D pose from single silhouettes ambiguous. To handle this, the method is embedded in a novel regressive tracking framework, using dynamics from the previous state estimate together with a learned regression value to disambiguate the pose. We show that the resulting system tracks long sequences stably. For realism and good generalization over a wide range of viewpoints, we train the regressors on images resynthesized from real human motion capture data. The method is demonstrated for several representations of full body pose, both quantitatively on independent but similar test data and qualitatively on real image sequences. Mean angular errors of 4-6 degrees are obtained for a variety of walking motions.},

@article{Criminisi2011,
	abstract = {This paper presents a unified, efficient model of random decision forests which can be applied to a number of machine learning, computer vision and medical image analysis tasks. Our model extends existing forest-based techniques as it unifies clas- sification, regression, density estimation, manifold learning, semi- supervised learning and active learning under the same decision forest framework. This means that the core implementation needs be written and optimized only once, and can then be applied to many diverse tasks. The proposed model may be used both in a generative or dis- criminative way and may be applied to discrete or continuous, labelled or unlabelled data. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) proposing a single, proba- bilistic and efficient model for a variety of learning tasks; 2) demonstrat- ing margin-maximizing properties of classification forests; 3) introduc- ing density forests for learning accurate probability density functions; 4) proposing efficient algorithms for sampling from the forest genera- tive model; 5) introducing manifold forests for non-linear embedding and dimensionality reduction; 6) proposing new and efficient forest-based algorithms for transductive and active learning. We discuss how alternatives such as random ferns and extremely randomized trees stem from our more general model. This paper is directed at both students who wish to learn the ba- sics of decision forests, as well as researchers interested in our new contributions. It presents both fundamental and novel concepts in a structured way, with many illustrative examples and real-world appli- cations. Thorough comparisons with state of the art algorithms such as support vector machines, boosting and Gaussian processes are pre- sented and relative advantages and disadvantages discussed. The many synthetic examples and existing commercial applications demonstrate the validity of the proposed model and its flexibility.},

@article{RuiLi2006,
abstract = {Filtering based algorithms have become popular in tracking human body pose. Such algorithms can suffer the curse of dimensionality due to the high dimensionality of the pose state space; therefore, efforts have been dedicated to either smart sampling or reducing the dimensionality of the original pose state space. In this paper, a novel formulation that employs a dimensionality reduced state space for multi-hypothesis tracking is proposed. During off-line training, a mixture of factor analyzers is learned. Each factor analyzer can be thought of as a {\&}{\#}8220;local dimensionality reducer{\&}{\#}8221; that locally approximates the pose manifold. Global coordination between local factor analyzers is achieved by learning a set of linear mixture functions that enforces agreement between local factor analyzers. The formulation allows easy bidirectional mapping between the original body pose space and the low-dimensional space. During online tracking, the clusters of factor analyzers are utilized in a multiple hypothesis tracking algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm tracks 3D body pose efficiently and accurately , even when self-occlusion, motion blur and large limb movements occur. Quantitative comparisons show that the formulation produces more accurate 3D pose estimates over time than those that can be obtained via a number of previously-proposed particle filtering based tracking algorithms.},

@article{Mundermann2006,
abstract = {Over the centuries the evolution of methods for the capture of human movement has been motivated by the need for new information on the characteristics of normal and pathological human movement. This study was motivated in part by the need of new clinical approaches for the treatment and prevention of diseases that are influenced by subtle changes in the patterns movement. These clinical approaches require new methods to measure accurately patterns of locomotion without the risk of artificial stimulus producing unwanted artifacts that could mask the natural patterns of motion. Most common methods for accurate capture of three-dimensional human movement require a laboratory environment and the attachment of markers or fixtures to the body's segments. These laboratory conditions can cause unknown experimental artifacts. Thus, our understanding of normal and pathological human movement would be enhanced by a method that allows the capture of human movement without the constraint of markers or fixtures placed on the body. In this paper, the need for markerless human motion capture methods is discussed and the advancement of markerless approaches is considered in view of accurate capture of three-dimensional human movement for biomechanical applications. The role of choosing appropriate technical equipment and algorithms for accurate markerless motion capture is critical. The implementation of this new methodology offers the promise for simple, time-efficient, and potentially more meaningful assessments of human movement in research and clinical practice. The feasibility of accurately and precisely measuring 3D human body kinematics for the lower limbs using a markerless motion capture system on the basis of visual hulls is demonstrated.},

These guidelines should be used with Plug in Gait version 1.7 onwards. To check which version you are running, highlight either the static model or the dynamic model in the pipeline. Select options and then press the version tab. Plug in Gait is the next generation of the Vicon Clinical Manager software package. It employs the same model as referenced in Vicon Clinical Manager with some additional features. One such feature is the addition of an upper body model. With the addition of the upper body model, there is now the option to process lower body, upper body, or full body data. This guide will teach you how to process each model. All model processing occurs in Workstation, thereby allowing a smooth pipeline into Polygon, Vicon's multimedia reporting tool. The Plug in Gait Checklist This checklist is provided to give the user a step by step guideline on how to process data using the Plug in Gait software package. This guideline will not cover marker placement. This topic will be covered in another section. In order to properly process the model, a static and dynamic trial are required. The static trial MUST have a heel marker. Plug In Gait allows you the option to keep the heel marker in a dynamic trial in order to treat the foot as a segment. The model is designed to automatically detect the presence of this marker and make its calculations appropriately. The model will also automatically detect the presence of a Knee Alignment Device (KAD) provided that the markers are labeled properly. With these details out of the way, lets begin. 1. In Workstation, open the static c3d file. If one is not already created, open the tvd file, reconstruct and label. 2. Next go to the subject measurements window located under the "Trial" pull down menu. (Trial|Subject Measurements). 3. You can see from this view that there are some fields that have yellow hue. These fields are the mandatory fields and need to be filled in on order for the model to run.},

The motion measurement system utilizes a video-based data collection strategy similar to commercially available systems for motion data collection. Anatomically aligned, passive, retroreflective markers placed on the subject are illuminated, detected, and stored in dedicated camera hardware while data are acquired from force platforms and EMG transducers. Three-dimensional marker position information is used to determine: (i) the orientation of segmentally-embedded coordinate systems, (ii) instantaneous joint center locations, and (iii) joint angles. Joint kinetics, i.e., moments and powers, may also be computed if valid force plate data are collected.},

abstract = {A new approach toward target representation and localization, the central component in visual tracking of nonrigid objects, is proposed. The feature histogram-based target representations are regularized by spatial masking with an isotropic kernel. The masking induces spatially-smooth similarity functions suitable for gradient-based optimization, hence, the target localization problem can be formulated using the basin of attraction of the local maxima. We employ a metric derived from the Bhattacharyya coefficient as similarity measure, and use the mean shift procedure to perform the optimization. In the presented tracking examples, the new method successfully coped with camera motion, partial occlusions, clutter, and target scale variations. Integration with motion filters and data association techniques is also discussed. We describe only a few of the potential applications: exploitation of background information, Kalman tracking using motion models, and face tracking.},
